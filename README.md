## Changes for HW5
I have been removing a few unused component such as the dialog and replace the first intro page with image and big headliner to introduce myself to attract more attention. I change the quick links from just words like "Github" and "Linkedin" to svg icon so that it is more attractive and visually better for the user as well. I also fix the UCSD image in the about page to figure so that it match with the profile image, avoiding all the unecessary errors and styling.
